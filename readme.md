## Introduction
This is a tool to help me repair mysql on xampp that i installed on windows 11, sometimes on several occasions mysql always errors, so to make my life easier without having to copy every single folder and file in ```xampp\mysql\data``` and ```xampp\mysql\backup```, I made this tool.

## It's very easy to use this tool
1. Edit ```repair.bat``` 
2. Change ``xamppLocation=Your XAMPP Location``
3. For example, change it to ```xamppLocation=c:\xampp```
4. Then run ```repair.bat```
